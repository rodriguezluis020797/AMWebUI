            <p>
                We’re a platform built by freelancers, for freelancers — designed to help providers like you manage
                appointments, stay
                connected with clients, and grow your business, all in one place. With intuitive scheduling and
                real-time SMS
                notifications, staying organized has never been easier. Our built-in analytics offer clear insights into
                cancellation
                trends, repeat no-shows, and client behavior, so you can make smarter business decisions. Whether you’re
                just starting
                out or scaling up, our powerful yet easy-to-use tools are crafted to support your success — and we’re
                just getting
                started.

        <div class="col-12">
            <h4 class="mb-3 text-muted">What is the cost?</h4>
            <p>
                We believe in simple, transparent pricing.
                Our service starts at just <strong>$10/month</strong>, with an additional <strong>$0.03 USD per SMS
                    notification</strong> sent to your clients from the previous month.
                Your first month is a flat $10 — no extra fees.
                If you decide to cancel, your final invoice will only include the cost of any notifications sent.
                Taxes and payment processing fees may apply.

            <h4 class="mb-3 text-muted">Is my data secure? Is my client's data secure?</h4>
            <p>
                Absolutely. Your trust is our top priority.
                We follow industry-leading security practices, including encryption of sensitive data, regular audits,
                and secure data storage standards.
                Whether it’s your information or your client’s, we treat it with the highest level of care and
                protection.

            <h4 class="mb-3 text-muted">Is my credit card data secure?</h4>
            <p>
                Yes — we never handle or store your credit card information ourselves.
                All payments are processed securely through our trusted partner <a href="https://stripe.com/"

                a global leader in secure online payments. Your financial data stays encrypted and protected at every
                step.

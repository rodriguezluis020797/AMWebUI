            <p>
                We’re a platform built by freelancers, for freelancers — designed to help providers like you manage
                appointments, stay connected with clients, and grow your business, all in one place. With intuitive
                scheduling and real-time SMS notifications, staying organized has never been easier. Our built-in
                analytics offer clear insights into cancellation trends, repeat no-shows, and client behavior, so you
                can make smarter business decisions. Whether you’re just starting out or scaling up, our powerful yet
                easy-to-use tools are crafted to support your success — and we’re just getting started.

        <div id="cost" class="col-12">
            <h4 class="mb-3 text-muted">What is the cost?</h4>
            <p>
                We believe in simple, transparent pricing.
                Our service starts at just <strong>$10/month</strong>, with an additional <strong>$0.03 USD per SMS
                    notification</strong> sent to your clients from the previous month.
                Your first month is a flat $10 — no extra fees.
                If you decide to cancel, your final invoice will only include the cost of any notifications sent.
                Taxes and payment processing fees may apply.

            <h4 class="mb-3 text-muted">What kind of providers use this?</h4>
            <p>
                We serve a wide range of service-based professionals — from fitness coaches and massage therapists to
                consultants, stylists, and tutors. If you rely on client appointments to run your business, this
                platform is built for you.

        <div id="install" class="col-12">
            <h4 class="mb-3 text-muted">Do I need to install anything?</h4>
            <p>
                Not at all. Our platform is completely web-based, so there’s nothing to download or install. You can
                access your account anytime, from anywhere — no apps or updates required.
            </p>

        <div id="data-security" class="col-12">
            <h4 class="mb-3 text-muted">Is my data secure?</h4>
            <p>
                Absolutely. Your trust is our top priority.
                We follow industry-leading security practices, including encryption of sensitive data, regular audits,
                and secure data storage standards.
                Whether it’s your information or your client’s, we treat it with the highest level of care and
                protection.

        <div id="card-security" class="col-12">
            <h4 class="mb-3 text-muted">Is my credit card data secure?</h4>
            <p>
                Yes — we never handle or store your credit card information ourselves.
                All payments are processed securely through our trusted partner <a href="https://stripe.com/"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe</a>,
                a global leader in secure online payments. Your financial data stays encrypted and protected at every
